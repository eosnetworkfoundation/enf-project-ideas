# Other Things That Will Be Getting Proposals

## State Slicing
A solution for deriving the "state slice" that impacts a particular account or smart contract.  This would allow for nodes to be deployed on a system and only keep the database state that it actively has to.

## DApp Shares
A solution for moving speculation underneath the EOS token level.  This will be purely decentralized with automatic payouts to share holders, verification at the set-code level of smart contract revenue sinks for calculating payouts (they can't hide funds), etc.

## DApp Store
A solution for ENF to make revenue by providing an app store like experience overlaid on top of EOS.

## System BIOS
Moving consensus mechanisms into the virtualized smart contract space (achievable with NatiVM).  Things like virtualized accounts, host functions exist at this layer, no more need for protocol features.

## State History Servlets
A simple framework for small servlets that permute chain data to a schema the user provides via a protobuf and yaml.

## True Plugins
A proper plugin framework for shared object plugins.  This would remove the need for things like deepmind to be intertwined in the source code and for external projects/companies to build plugins to our system easily.
